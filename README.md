# Stress-Analysis-Automation
Desktop application to draw weld profile lines and calculate Factor of Safety.

## About

This desktop application allows the user to draw in a canvas 2D or even 3D weld profiles to calculate its factor of safety.
- It gets inputs from user of the forces and moments, the weld leg size (W) and the material tensile strength.
- Then it calculates the weld centroid, moments of inertia, allowable force per inch of weld and the resultant force.

## ‚Å†‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
This app is still in development
- This application uses theory applying for **fillet welds only**.
- Avoid overlapping lines because this will affect the calculations results.
- The weld profile drawing and input forces and moments must coincide with the coordinate system shown in canvas.
- The factor of safety shown is the most critical. Meaning, the application performs iterative calculations through each vertice of the weld profile.
- You can just draw profiles with right angles.
- There is no functionality to zoom in/out the canvas drawing.
- You can not resize lines in the drawing.
- The code was made for a pre-junior dev. So it has a weak structure. Most of the logic is in the mainform and that was a huge mistake. There are no unit tests created for this.

## üé®  Features
- Saving and opening drawings.
- Add more materials to local data base.
- Export calculation results to an excel file (shows forces calculations and analysis results over each drawing's vertice).
